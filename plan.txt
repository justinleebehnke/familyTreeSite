Must be in HTML & css
Different from the original site

Provide fake data for your website
You could mock up what a clone of family search might look like

Deliverables:

1. Home Page : //the tree itself will be the home Screen? No.. I can use a grid page for that instead
2. 3+ additional pages: //contact me form //About me // the tree itself //about the project
3. The site uses some images: //these could be in the tree tiles
4. the tree page uses css grid or flex box... probably just grid though
5. The contact me page will have a form
6. I need to have a footer with a link to my github repo

It needs to be on my digital ocean server.
I will make sure the form is working and all links

So I think I will use the basic template that that guy created.
Only have it do my tree, and include links that all link to informational pages for each individual
Family member. (for the mockup they will all link to the dummy page) but it will be formatted using grid
to display the person's information.

// the tree itself where all parts are links to more information about each person
// a contact me page that uses the form
// an about the project page
// a dummy extra content page that links back to the tree page // this will use a grid layout
